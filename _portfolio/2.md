<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Tumor-infiltrating B cells are an important component in the microenvironment with unclear anti-tumor impacts. We enhanced our previous computational algorithm TRUST to extract the B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) hypervariable regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data. TRUST assembled over 30 million complementarity-determining region 3(CDR3s) of the B cell heavy chain (IgH)from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Widespread B cell clonal expansions and Ig subclass switch events were observed in diverse human cancers. Prevalent somatic copy number alterationsin MICA and MICB genes related to antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) were identified in tumors with elevated B cell activity. IgG3-1 subclass switch interacts with the B cell receptor affinity maturation and defects in the ADCC pathway. Comprehensive pan-cancer analyses of tumor-infiltrating B cell receptor repertoires identified novel tumor immune evasion mechanisms through genetic alterations. The IgH sequences identified here are potentially useful resources for future development of immunotherapies.</p>
