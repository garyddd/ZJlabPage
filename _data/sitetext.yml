        desc: "T and B cells are the two cores of the adaptive immune system, and both express antigen-specific receptors at their surface, namely, T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs). The broad diversity of TCR and BCR ensures that the adaptive immune system is capable of recognizing a vast array of antigens, including pathogens, auto-antigens, allergens, and tumor neoantigens. Thus profiling and characterizing those antigen-specific receptors has become an important part of basic and clinical immunology research. We are interested in developing computational technologies to investigate the link between TCR/BCR sequence and epitope binding specificity, and to explore their potential for disease detection and monitoring the responses to therapy."

      - title: "Multi-omics Data Mining "
        desc: "The concept of “omics” refers to the fact that all or nearly all instances of the targeted molecular space are measured in the assay, and therefore they provide holistic views of the biological system. The efficient processing and analysis of the omics data, especially extracting and discovering patterns from these data, has brought many challenges to bioinformatics and computational biology. As a computational biologist with a background in computer science, I’m particularly interested in developing and applying novel machine learning and data mining approaches to address these challenges.
